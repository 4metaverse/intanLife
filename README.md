# üêæ PetLife üêæ

PetLife is a decentralized version of the Instagram platform where each viewer has to become a follower for him/her to have access to the exclusive content of their favorite pets. This creates a more strong relationship between pets and fans which allows fans to connect with their favorite pet in real life throug lifestream videos. Whenever a viewer goes to PetLife will be able to check sample works from different pets, see details from specific pets and unlock exclusive content. The data is stored on IPFS and the generated hash will be used to create an NFT of a photo.

# How it's made
